## Inheritance
- Object of diffrent classes may share the common properties and behaviours
- Example : Library System
    - Types of items for loans:
        - CD
        - books
        - magazine
- These items share some of the common propertis.
- Thus a [**superclass**](#superclass) "LoanItem" is defined
- CD, Book and Magazine classes inherits from LoanItem class
- Those classes inherit from superclass are called [**subclasses**](#subclass)
---
