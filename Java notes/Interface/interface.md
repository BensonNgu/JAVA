# WHAT IS AN INTERFACE IN JAVA ?
- A template that can be apply to a class
- Similar to inheritance but not all
- Interface = [inheritance](linkToPaste) + [abstract](linkToPaste)

# DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INTERFACE AND INHERITANCE
| **Interface**   | **Inheritance**   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| - Each class can apply more than one interface | - Each class can only inherites one superclass |
| - It specifies what a class must do (method) | - The superclass has "predefined" method(s) that can be invoked by all the subclasses, and each subclass can override the method that's "predefined" in its superclass     |
| - No content is needed for every body of each mothod declared in the interface  | - There should be content in each method's body of the superclass |
